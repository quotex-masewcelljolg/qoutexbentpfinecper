# What is Quotex?

Quotex is an online broker that offers binary options trading, a
financial product where traders can speculate on the price movements of
assets within a specified time frame. If a trader correctly predicts the
direction of the asset\'s price, they receive a predetermined payout.
Otherwise, they lose their investment.
